## Description

* An isometric 3D puzzle game that places the player in procedurally generated mazes filled with obstacles. It contains ten levels (with increasing difficulty), 24 handmade rooms and 80 variations of traps that can be avoided using different combinations of actions (such as jumping, dodging, crawling etc.).

* Each level is generated as a labyrinth with a unique solution. Inside the labyrinth are procedurally placed traps, and also rooms that can contain items with different types of rarities and effects. The player's mission is to find ten artifacts (each level contains somewhere inside an artifact object).

* The levels get progressively harder. Their difficulty is defined by their size and by the complexity of the traps within (each trap has variations of different levels of difficulty).

## Technologies used

* Aside from the main character ([Unity asset store](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/robots/space-robot-kyle-4696)) and their animations ([Mixamo](https://www.mixamo.com/#/)), everything was developed and created from scratch. I used Unity as a game engine and C# for the programming part; Blender for modeling, UV unwrapping, texturing and animation; Krita for texture editing.

## Demo

* An example (Youtube video) of a complete run through all ten levels:
